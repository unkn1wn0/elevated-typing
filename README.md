# Elevated Typing

**Elevated Typing** is a simple AutoHotkey script I created to solve my own workflow issues with typing superscript and subscript characters.  
Switch between subscript and superscript modes with easy hotkeys.

## Features

- **Instant superscript/subscript typing** in any app
- All available Unicode characters for numbers and Latin letters
- Simple mode toggling with hotkeys (`Ctrl+Win+P` for superscript, `Ctrl+Win+B` for subscript)
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Why?

I made this script for personal use because existing sub/superscript typing methods were slow and clunky.  
Feel free to use, modify, or improve it as you wish!

## Issues

There are multiple issues that need to be fixed

- The mappings for subscript don't exist for a few letters, meaning some keys don't work with subscript
